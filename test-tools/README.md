Analysis of 4_app_voicechat_rt.js

Purpose: This script establishes a WebSocket connection to OpenAI’s Realtime API (gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17), sends audio from a local PCM file (input_audio.pcm), and receives both text transcription and audio responses in real-time. It simulates streaming by sending audio in chunks and saves the returned audio as a PCM file.

Key Components:
  Modules: Uses ws for WebSocket communication, fs for file operations, and dotenv to load environment variables (like the OpenAI API key).
  WebSocket: Connects to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime with authentication via an API key and beta header.
  Audio Handling: Reads 16-bit PCM audio, sends it in 100ms chunks (4800 bytes at 24kHz), and receives audio responses in PCM16 format, appending them to a file.
  Logging: Logs events (connection, chunks sent, responses, errors) with timestamps to the console.
  OpenAI Interaction: Configures the API to return both text and audio responses, with custom instructions for a friendly English voice.

Execution Flow:
  Initialization: Loads the API key, sets up input/output file paths, and initializes an empty output PCM file.
  WebSocket Connection: Opens a connection to OpenAI’s Realtime API with authentication.
  Audio Sending: Reads input_audio.pcm, splits it into 4800-byte chunks (100ms at 24kHz), sends each chunk as base64-encoded data with a 100ms delay, and commits the buffer.
  Response Request: Requests a response in text and audio (PCM16 format) with specific instructions.
  Message Handling: Processes incoming messages:
  Logs errors, text transcriptions (partial and complete), and audio deltas.
   Appends audio deltas to the output file.
   Closes the connection when the response is complete.
  Error Handling: Catches and logs WebSocket errors and execution failures.

Key Features:
  Simulates real-time audio streaming with a 100ms delay between chunks.
  Supports both text and audio responses from OpenAI.
  Saves the audio response as a PCM file with a timestamped name.
